rt-server-client TODO list
--------------------------

- optimize code - working with database
- check behavior with cisco switches
- add support for other virtualization technologies hypervisor hosts (openvz, kvm, vmware)
- Actually handle "duplicate" systems rather than doing nothing
- lib/ToolBox/dell/__init__.py should be updated with logic wrapped around the BeautifulSoup import to correctly select the module appropriate to the local system
